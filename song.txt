Leaders are hard to come by
Followers are omnipresent
Satisfied with a mediocre lifestyle

Leaders are hard to come by
Followers are omnipresent

No one is setting a path for us to follow
No one's striving to be on top
No one is setting a path for us to follow
We will all fall in the end!
In dying days!
The path has been set
You're leading far astray
Far astray!
The path has been set
You're leading far astray
Far Astray!
